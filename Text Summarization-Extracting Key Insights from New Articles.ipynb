      "Logos for MasterCard and Visa credit cards at the entrance of a New York coffee shopIn the latest blow to Russia’s financial system after its invasion of Ukraine, Mastercard and Visa said they are suspending their operations in the country. Mastercard said cards issued by Russian banks will no longer be supported by its network and any Mastercard issued outside the country will not work at Russian stores or ATMs.“We don’t take this decision lightly,” Mastercard said in a statement, adding that it made the move after discussions with customers, partners and governments.Visa said it’s working with clients and partners in Russia to cease all Visa transactions over the coming days.“We are compelled to act following Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, and the unacceptable events that we have witnessed,” Visa Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Al Kelly said in a statement.The twin suspensions were announced within 16 minutes of each other, and they followed a private video call earlier in the day between President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine and US lawmakers. During that conversation, Zelenskyy “asked us to turn off MasterCard and Visa for Russia,” Rep. Brad Sherman, a Democrat from California, tweeted. “I agree,” he added before Mastercard and Visa made their announcements.Earlier in the week, Visa and Mastercard had announced more limited moves to block financial institutions from the networks that serve as arteries for the payments system. Russian people have already been hit hard by heavy sanctions and financial penalties imposed by the US government and others.Since the invasion of Ukraine, the value of the Russian currency, the ruble, has plunged by more than a third to a record low. That’s pushing up inflation for Russian households, and all the fear has helped cause long lines at ATMs.Many other companies around the world have also made moves to increase the financial pressure on Russia and its people because of its attack on Ukraine. Some are selling their stakes in Russian companies, such as energy giant BP, while others like Harley-Davidson halted product shipments to the country.“This war and the ongoing threat to peace and stability demand we respond in line with our values,” Visa’s Kelly said.The moves by Mastercard and Visa could make real differences to their bottom lines. Russia accounted for 4% of all of Visa’s net revenue in its last fiscal year, including money made from domestic and cross-border activities. Ukraine accounted for about 1%, Visa said in a filing with US securities regulators this week.Mastercard said in its own filing that about 4% of its net revenues during 2021 came from business conducted within, into and out of Russia. Another roughly 2% was related to Ukraine.(With inputs from AP)Also Read | Russia-Ukraine war: Israeli PM Bennett meets Putin in Moscow to discuss Ukraine crisis\n",

       "'logos for mastercard and visa credit cards at the entrance of a new york coffee shopin the latest blow to russia’s financial system after its invasion of ukraine, mastercard and visa said they are suspending their operations in the country. mastercard said cards issued by russian banks will no longer be supported by its network and any mastercard issued outside the country will not work at russian stores or atms.“we don’t take this decision lightly,” mastercard said in a statement, adding that it made the move after discussions with customers, partners and governments.visa said it’s working with clients and partners in russia to cease all visa transactions over the coming days.“we are compelled to act following russia’s unprovoked invasion of ukraine, and the unacceptable events that we have witnessed,” visa chairman and chief executive officer al kelly said in a statement.the twin suspensions were announced within 16 minutes of each other, and they followed a private video call earlier in the day between president volodymyr zelenskyy of ukraine and us lawmakers. during that conversation, zelenskyy “asked us to turn off mastercard and visa for russia,” rep. brad sherman, a democrat from california, tweeted. “i agree,” he added before mastercard and visa made their announcements.earlier in the week, visa and mastercard had announced more limited moves to block financial institutions from the networks that serve as arteries for the payments system. russian people have already been hit hard by heavy sanctions and financial penalties imposed by the us government and others.since the invasion of ukraine, the value of the russian currency, the ruble, has plunged by more than a third to a record low. that’s pushing up inflation for russian households, and all the fear has helped cause long lines at atms.many other companies around the world have also made moves to increase the financial pressure on russia and its people because of its attack on ukraine. some are selling their stakes in russian companies, such as energy giant bp, while others like harley-davidson halted product shipments to the country.“this war and the ongoing threat to peace and stability demand we respond in line with our values,” visa’s kelly said.the moves by mastercard and visa could make real differences to their bottom lines. russia accounted for 4% of all of visa’s net revenue in its last fiscal year, including money made from domestic and cross-border activities. ukraine accounted for about 1%, visa said in a filing with us securities regulators this week.mastercard said in its own filing that about 4% of its net revenues during 2021 came from business conducted within, into and out of russia. another roughly 2% was related to ukraine.(with inputs from ap)also read | russia-ukraine war: israeli pm bennett meets putin in moscow to discuss ukraine crisis'"

    "text='''Mahendra Singh Dhoni, fondly known as \"Captain Cool\" or simply \"Mahi,\" is a cricketing legend whose name resonates with resilience, leadership, and unparalleled sportsmanship. Born on July 7, 1981, in Ranchi, India, Dhoni emerged from the cricketing wilderness of Jharkhand to become one of India's most iconic cricketers. Renowned for his calm demeanor under pressure, Dhoni's captaincy tenure saw India scale unprecedented heights, including the 2007 ICC World Twenty20 title, the 2010 and 2016 Asia Cup victories, and the crowning glory of the 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup triumph, where he led the team to glory with his astute leadership and match-winning prowess. Beyond his captaincy, Dhoni's batting prowess, particularly his finishing skills, made him a nightmare for bowlers in the limited-overs formats. His unorthodox yet effective batting style, coupled with lightning-quick glove work behind the stumps, cemented his status as one of the greatest wicketkeeper-batsmen of all time. Even after stepping down from captaincy, Dhoni continued to be a guiding force for the Indian team, his mere presence on the field instilling confidence in his teammates. Beyond the cricketing arena, Dhoni's humility, integrity, and philanthropic endeavors have earned him adoration and respect worldwide, making him not just a cricketing icon but also a role model for generations to come.'''"

They have to wait until after June 1.The restriction on movement was imposed as a precautionary measure on April 20, after construction sites looked set to be potential hotbeds of infection.The SHN was slated to last till May 4 but was extended after the number of infected construction work pass holders living outside purpose-built dormitories continued to rise.Advisories on the latest move were sent to employers last Friday (May 15) by the Manpower Ministry and the Building and Construction Authority (BCA), reminding them to inform their employees to abide by circuit breaker measures even after the SHN ends.Much like the rest of Singapore, foreign workers can go out only for specific purposes such as buying food and groceries or to seek urgent medical attention.About 180,000 foreign workers and their dependents were affected by the SHN, said a report by The Straits Times.Currently, only 5 per cent of the construction workforce is at work on critical projects that include those which cannot be left idle for too long for safety reasons.\\xa0(With PTI inputs)Also Read |\\xa0Singapore reports 465 new COVID-19 casesAlso Read |\\xa0Singapore reports 793 new COVID-19 cases, mostly foreign workers'"
